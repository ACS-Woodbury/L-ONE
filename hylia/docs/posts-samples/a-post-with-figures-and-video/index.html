You can also edit the markdown file directly if you prefer not to use the CMS.</p><p>If you want to make an image bleed-out, add a title attribute to it and the front-end will automatically wrap it in a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> tag for you.</p><p><img src="/L-ONE/images/demo-image-1.jpg" alt="The top of a grey concrete building with a blue sky in the background" title="Brutalism at its finest.
